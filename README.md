# The (under)talked problem of Climate Change

*"We have a single mission: to protect and hand on the planet to the next generation."* - Francois Hollande

Climate change is a global issue with global repercussions. We read, see, hear every day about the potential ecological disaster we are facing.

We will try, through this study, to conclude if we can deny or not some prejudice about climate change. For example, what kind of people are concerned about climate change. Is it always the youngest or, perhaps, politicians from a left-wing party? 

It is believed that all people, regardless of their background, should have an impact when it comes to facing the problem of climate change. Our goal is to determine how different groups of people react to this threat. Even though a person's nationality, age, political party, etc. separates him or her from other people, the desire for a better tomorrow is why the differences should be left aside.
